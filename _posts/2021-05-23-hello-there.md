## Welcome!

Hello there.

Ruados's the name, but you can call me Rua. I'm a sysadmin with a vein for networking. Cables, not people. Technology is simpler.
The objective of this blog is for me to show off what can be done on both servers and workstations, from dwelling in /etc and its many config files, to personalize your desktop and get things working. My focus will be with Linux and BSD, but I might throw a little of Windows every now and then. And who knows, I might throw some Cisco into the mix.

Everything I'll show takes in assumption the user knows how to install a operating system and isn't afraid of terminals or breaking things down. 

Indeed, the best skill a sysadmin can have, and really anyone, is to be able to break things and put it back together. And laugh.

With that said, I'm happy to have you for the ride.

See you, Space cowboy...
